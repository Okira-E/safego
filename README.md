# SafeGo

safego is a Go library that provides a Rust-like Option enum for safer handling of optional values. The Option type allows you to represent the presence or absence of a value in a type-safe manner, reducing the chances of runtime errors related to nil or null values.

## Installation

To use safego in your Go project, you need to have Go installed and set up on your machine. Then, you can install the library using the go get command:

```shell
go get github.com/Okira-E/safego
```

## Usage

It will always be faster to make a file called `option.go` and copy the source code.

### Creating an Option

To create an `Option` with a value, use the `Some` function:

```go
opt := safego.Some(42)
```

### Checking if an Option has a value

There are multiple ways to get the value of an Option. You can use the Expect method to retrieve the value and panic with a custom error message if the Option is empty:

```go
val := opt.Expect("Option is empty")
```

If you are confident that the Option has a value and want to retrieve it without error handling, you can use the Unwrap method. However, if the Option is empty, it will panic with a default error message:

```go
val := opt.Unwrap()
```

To safely get the value with a default fallback value, you can use the UnwrapOr method. If the Option is empty, it will return the provided default value:

```go
val := opt.UnwrapOr(0)
```

If you want to specify a function to generate the default value, you can use the UnwrapOrElse method. If the Option is empty, it will invoke the provided function and return its result:

```go
val := opt.UnwrapOrElse(func() int {
    // Generate and return the default value
})
```
